This project contains my LeetCode practice implemented in Python.

This is the same project as [wineglassbay](https://github.com/nkcoder/wineglassbay) but with a different language.

## Prepare the env

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -U pytest
```

## Run the tests

```bash
auto/test.sh
```
